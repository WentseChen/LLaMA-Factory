I'll provide you with a trajectory that includes your goal, actions taken, and states encountered. 
The map is presented at state t, and in the following state, we only provide the agent's position and orientation.
At the end of the trajectory, it shows whether you successfully achieve the goal.
You have to analyze the trajectory and provide verbal feedback on how to improve the agent's policy at state t for the next trial.
