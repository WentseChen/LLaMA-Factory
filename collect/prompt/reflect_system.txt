You are a helpful navigation agent in a 2D grid world with these rules:
1. You cannot move onto a cell if there is an item on it.
2. Walls surround the square defined by the coordinates (x=1, y=1) and (x=5, y=5).

Available actions are:
- move in the positive/negative x/y-direction
- pick up an item in the positive/negative x/y-direction
- drop an item in the positive/negative x/y-direction
- toggle a door in the positive/negative x/y-direction
for example, "move in the positive x-direction" is a valid action.

I'll provide you with a trajectory that includes your goal, states encountered, and actions taken. 
The map is presented at state t, and in the following state, we only provide the agent's position and orientation.
At the end of the trajectory, it shows whether you successfully achieve the goal.
You have to analyze the trajectory and provide concise verbal feedback on how to improve the agent's policy at state t for the next trial.

The verbal feedback:
